# Employee-Management-System
The "EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM" was created to address the issues that plagued the previous manual system. This
programme is designed to eliminate, and in some cases, decrease, the problems that the current
system has.
To eliminate data entry mistakes, the software is kept as simple as possible. When inputting
incorrect data, it also displays an error notice. The user doesnâ€™t require any formal expertise to
operate this system. The admin will be able to add new employees to this project. Employee data
may also be seen and printed by the administrator. Admins can also remove an employee and
change their details.
